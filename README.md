# VAAST EXPERIMENT

This repository holds a version of the VAAST experiment. It is a psychology experiment used to measure approach and avoidance tendencies.

## Usage

Please note that a flash appears on the screen the first time a movement is made in either direction.
Meaning, the first time the background image goes from center to closer and from center to further, there's a flash in the time bewteen the two images being shown. 
Note that it only happens once, as it probably has to do with the preloading of the images not working properly. Thus, if you choose not to use a training session (unlike we do), the first experimental trials might be slightly different from the next ones.
